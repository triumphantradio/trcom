                        documentations,
                        andphotossubmitted to Corre for safety and security purposes. This includes real time 2-step
                        validation code feature, which prompts delivery persons to validate code from shipper to matche
                        shippers request for a service. This process is replicated at the point of final delivery to the
                        recipient of the goods/item.</li>
                    <li> Using device, location, profile, usage, and other data to prevent, detect, and combat fraud or
                        unsafe activities.</li>
                    <li> Using user ratings and feedback to encourage compliance with our guideline and as grounds for

                    Using dispatcherlocation information, and communications between shipperand dispatcher, to identify
                    cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine by using such
                    information that a dispatcher is delaying a shipperpickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will
                    not charge the shippera cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the dispatcherto omit
                    such a fee.</p><br>

                        and they consent to the sharing.</ol><br>
                    <p>E. Data retention and deletion<br>
                        Correretains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.
                        Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. Corre may retain user data after a
                        deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for the reasons stated in this
                        policy.
                        Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings > Privacy menus in
                        the
                        Correapp, or through Corre’s website Following an account deletion request, Corredeletes the

                        account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for
                        purposes
                        of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account
                        such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal
                        and
                        regulatory requirements relating to delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their

                        generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for

                    B- Device permissions
                    <p>Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that
                        apps cannot access without the device owner’s permission. iOS devices notify users the first
                        time
                        the Correapp requests permission to access certain types of data and gives users the option to
                        grant
                        or refuse permission. Android devices notify users of the permissions that the Corre app seeks
                        before their first use of the app, and use of the app constitutes a grant of such permission.

                        average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for
                        whom they provide or receive services.
