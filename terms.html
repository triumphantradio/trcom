                        directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where
                        required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined
                        by Corre. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services
                        received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services. Corre will
                        respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a
                        particular service or good.<br><br>
                        All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Corre using the preferred
                        payment method designated in your Account, after which Corre will send you a receipt by email.
                        If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not
                        able to be charged, you agree that Corre may, as the Third Party Provider’s limited payment
                        collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.<br><br>
                        As between you and Corre, Corre reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges
                        for any or all services obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Corre’s sole
                        discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical
                        areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Corre will use reasonable efforts
                        to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges
                        incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
                        Corre may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may
                        result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through
                        the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also
                        made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied
                        to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider
                        at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a
                        cancellation fee.<br><br>
                        This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services
                        or goods provided. Corre does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to
                        the Third-Party Provider. Any representation by Corre (on Corre’s website, in the Application,
                        or in Corre’s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,”
                        and/or “included” in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to
                        suggest that Corre provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third
                        Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment
                        as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained
                        through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you
                        have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to
                        rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.<br><br>
                        Repair or Cleaning Fees.<br>
                        You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, Third
                        Party Provider vehicles and property resulting from use of the Services.
